 <h2>[ The Problem ]</h2>
   <h2>Background of the Problem</h2>
<br><p>Children are among the most vulnerable members of society. 
<br>Unfortunately, they are often easy targets of abuse, exploitation, and neglect, sometimes even within their own families, where they should feel safest.
<br>
<br>Abuse comes in many forms:
<br>physical violence, sexual exploitation, child labor, neglect, and emotional mistreatment. 
<br>According to global studies, a child loses their life to violence every four minutes, showing the tragic scale of the problem.
<br>Violence against children knows no boundaries.
<br>It can occur anytime and anywhere: 
<br>At home, in schools, on the streets, in institutions, and even online.
<br>
<br>Every child has the right to grow up in a safe and nurturing environment
<br>where they can fully develop into strong, healthy, and capable adults.
<br>However, this is not the reality for millions of children around the world. 
<br>Children born in low and middle-income countries face far greater risks
<br>due to poverty, limited access to healthcare, lack of education,
<br> and weak protective systems. 
<br>
<br>The gap in survival and well-being is staggering, and without proper
<br>awareness and action, these inequalities will only continue. 
<br>Protecting children from harm is not just a responsibility,
<br>it is a moral obligation for all of society.</p>

 <h2>What is being done about it in the Philippines?</h2>
 <br>In the Philippines, child safety and health remain pressing issues.
 <br>A shocking reality is that a child’s birth is considered one of the
 <br>most dangerous moments of their life due to the high risks linked to
 <br>poor healthcare access and malnutrition.
 
 <br>Many Filipino children do not survive their first year, and those who do often face lifelong challenges caused by poor nutrition and unsafe environments.
<br>
<br>Statistics reveal that the Philippines ranks ninth worldwide in terms of the number of stunted children. Those kids who are too small for their age due to malnutrition.
<br>Around one in three Filipino children suffers from stunting, a condition that not only affects their physical growth but also their cognitive development, making it harder for them to succeed in school and later in life.
<br>While the government and NGOs have launched feeding programs, health campaigns, and protective laws, the challenges remain immense. 
<br>Addressing this issue requires consistent community involvement, better health services, and stronger child protection systems that truly reach the most vulnerable families.

 <h2>Purpose of My Page</h2>
 <br>The main purpose of my page is to raise awareness and spark meaningful conversations
 <br>about child safety, health, and protection. It aims to shed light on the dangers and
 <br>challenges children face, particularly in urban areas where poverty, abuse,
 <br>and neglect are often hidden behind closed doors. By providing information, statistics,
 <br>and solutions, the page hopes to serve as a platform where people can learn about the
 <br>real issues affecting children and how they can help.  
<br>
<br>This advocacy page will also highlight existing support systems and solutions.
<br>Such as hotlines, community programs, and organizations that individuals and
<br>families can access. While child abuse and neglect remain widespread and complex
<br>problems, awareness is the first step toward change. By spreading knowledge,
<br>encouraging dialogue, and offering resources, this page intends to inspire action.
<br>Children deserve to feel safe, to be loved, and to live without fear.
<br>Together, we can protect their innocence and help them grow up in a world where
<br>they are truly valued and cared for.

  <p>As the majority of respondents were from PNP, the survey provided an opportunity to understand the 
    perspectives of law enforcement officials and consider how these differ from other service providers. A
    key finding in this regard was that PNP respondents have a more positive perspective on the availability of
    services and response for OSAEC cases than barangay officials, social workers, NGO staff and other interview
    respondents. </p>
