 <h2>[ Who and How ]</h2>
   <h2>Who we are & how we started</h2>
<br><br>
<p>Children deserve a world that does not harm them.
<br>
<br>“Save the Angels” was founded on a simple belief: every child, everywhere, has the right to safety, compassion, and a future free from fear. What began as a small initiative just a handful of people who refused to look away has grown into an advocacy dedicated to protecting children from abuse, promoting health awareness, and cultivating emotional and physical wellness for the youngest members of our communities.
<br>
<br>We work to create environments where children are heard, protected, and empowered. Through outreach programs, educational campaigns, and support networks, we aim to provide both imimageste protection and long-term change.
<br>
<br>Our mission is not just to intervene, but to illuminate to shed light on the realities many children endure, and guide society toward responsibility, empathy, and action.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>We stand for:</h3>

<br>

<br>In a world that often turns its back on what it doesn’t want to see, we choose to look closer. We choose to act.
<br>
<br>We choose to protect the angels <a href="https://amongusplay.online/">among us</a>.
<br>
<br>Today Save the Angels is a community-led child protection and wellness organization that
<br>combines hands-on community outreach with policy advocacy and capacity building.
<br>
<br>Our core activities include school safety audits, community caregiver workshops on nutrition and mental health, child-friendly complaint and referral systems, and rapid-response support for families in crisis.
<br>We place special emphasis on prevention   through education, accessible health services, and strengthening local referral networks and on amplifying children’s voices 
when decisions affecting them are made. 
<br>
<br>Our work is rooted in the belief that every child deserves 
safety, dignity, and the chance to grow up healthy and heard.
